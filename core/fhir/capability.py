"""Render the server's CapabilityStatement from the FHIR mapping config.

GET /FHIR/R5/metadata is public (FHIR requires the capabilities interaction to
be retrievable) and exposes only resource-type names, interaction codes, and
search-param names -- all already public in fhir_config.json. The statement
follows the US Core server CapabilityStatement conventions (expectation
extensions, SMART security block) WITHOUT claiming US Core conformance: US
Core targets R4 and requires capabilities JHE does not serve (vread/history,
Provenance _revinclude, US Core profiles).

Dual-store honesty: a resource can be backed by a Django model (JHE-native)
and/or the FhirAuxResource store (imported records, selected with ``_source``).
Declared interactions and search params are the union of both stores, with
``documentation`` naming the caveats (which writes reach which store, which
params only apply under ``_source``), so a generic client is never silently
misled.
