    """An *auxiliary* FHIR resource stored as an opaque JSON blob.

    Every FHIR resource that does not fit the JHE-system view of a mapped Django model is
    stored here: its entire FHIR body lives in ``fhir_data`` and the server performs no
    computation on it beyond plain CRUD. The supported resource types are declared under
    ``aux_resources`` in core/fhir/fhir_config.json (mapped types appear there too -- their
    non-system rows fall through to this store).

    The primary key (and therefore the FHIR-facing ``id``) is a UUID, keeping it disjoint
    from the integer pks of the mapped models so a request can be routed by id shape. Every row
    is linked to a ``fhir_source`` (required) -- the patient-registered upstream source it was
    uploaded through, identified by the ``X-JHE-FHIR-Source-ID`` header -- which in turn carries
    the owning ``patient``. ``fhir_resource_id`` and ``patient_fhir_id`` are best-effort copies of
    the resource's own ``id`` and its referenced Patient id (both may be null).
